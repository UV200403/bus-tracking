# Bus-Tracking-System

This web application is on going project . The layouts for the website are ready while the functionality is still in progress.Starting month of the project was February 2022.
Bus Tracker System allows user to know about the current location of the college bus(student) which is using to reach his/her boarding point.
The system provides users to access the location of the bus using gps of bus driver.
The system estimates the time for the bus to reach the station where user is standing , also the time to reach the destination(college).
This helps user to know the time he would reach his destination in and doesnt not have to wait for long on the bus station.
The database keeps record of new and already registered users . According to that the route is selected automatically for the old users.
Checkpoints those are set on a given route helps system for estimation of the time .
This is a small scale project and has got a lot of future scope . 
As a part of college project we have selected only 4 routes to reach the student location and college.With the help of the web parents can easily know the location 
of their children.
And the college management also know when the bus will arrives
